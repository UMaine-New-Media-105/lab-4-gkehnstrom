In this lab we were tasked to create code that gave us shapes along with two sprites that interected with eachother. I used an If statemenmt that made it
so that if nothing is being clicked the Bear sprite would show up untikl you press down on the mouse pad the bear disappears and a planet shows up on the 
screen instead of the bear. This lab was especiallu challenging becuase there was so much to have organized and with multiple functions everything has to
be perfect.
